ElevenClock is **free software** (under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/marticliment/ElevenClock/blob/main/LICENSE)) that lets you put a **customizable clock on your Windows 11 taskbar(s)**. When Microsoft created the Windows 11 clock, they __forgot__ to make it customizable, and to show it on multiple displays. You can customize ElevenClock however you wish — from adding seconds, to changing its color scheme — __and__ it appears on all the displays
connected to your PC.
You can choose to show or hide the clock with full-screen apps, and what happens when you click, double-click or middle-click it.
Do you want a clock (or two clocks) on each of your displays? You can have them, and **customize them independently**, or leave them looking like the Windows’ clock... It’s your choice.
ElevenClock is millisecond-accurate, auto-synced with Internet Time... You can even set it to different time zones.

## Frequently asked questions

**Q: The clock shows over fullscreen**  
A: Enable fullscreen hiding in settings
#
**Q: The clock shows over RDP sessions**  
A: Enable RDP hiding in settings (it may consume more CPU)
#
**Q: Can ElevenClock be in my language?**  
A: Yes, just take a look at [TRANSLATION.md][translating link]
#
**Q: My antivirus is telling me that ElevenClock is a virus/My antivirus is uninstalling ElevenClock/My browser is blocking ElevenClock download**  
A: A common reason apps (i.e., executables) get blocked and/or detected as a virus — even when there's nothing malicious about them, like in the case of ElevenClock — is because they're not being used by a relatively large amount of people.

Combine that with the fact that you might be downloading something that was recently released, and simply blocking unknown apps is in many cases a good precaution to take in order to prevent actual malware.

Since ElevenClock is open source and safe to use, simply whitelist the app in the settings of your antivirus/browser.
#
**Q: The clock shows seconds when the "Show Seconds" settings is disabled**  
A: Check that you don't have seconds set in your regional settings and disable seconds following this [article's instructions](https://www.howtogeek.com/325096/how-to-make-windows-10s-taskbar-clock-display-seconds/) (Other guides might not work)
#
**Q: ElevenClock does not show the correct time zone when time zone is changed**  
A: Just restart ElevenClock (Right-click clock -> Restart ElevenClock)
#
**Q: The main clock does not get modified when enabling seconds, etc.**  
A: ElevenClock can't modify or update  the main clock due to Windows 11's restrictions.
